# COMSC-028-data-science - Foundations of Data Science

This course introduces students to the field of Data Science through computational and inferential thinking. Given data arising from some real-world problem, students will learn the fundamental skills in computer programming and statistical inference needed to analyze that data so as to understand and solve that problem. The course also addresses social issues surrounding data analysis, such as privacy, security, and design.

This repo contains my annotations as I work through the course in Spring 2025.
